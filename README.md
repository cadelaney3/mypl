# mypl
basic programming language written in C++ for Programming Languages class

Written for OPL class taken as a junion in college in Spring 2018. When run, it runs a simple program written in mypl, a basic programming language. The example mypl program can be seen in main.cpp.

Credit goes to Dr. David Schroeder of Gonzaga University, who wrote a large potion of the code and assigned the rest as homework for me to do.

to compile:

make
./mypl
